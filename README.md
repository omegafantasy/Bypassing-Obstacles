## Bypassing Obstacles

This is the Unity+C# implementation for paper "**Efficiently Bypassing Obstacles to Reach Specified Locations: A Curvature Gain-Based Redirected Walking Strategy**".

The project is based on [OpenRDW2](https://github.com/omegafantasy/OpenRDW2), a Redirected Walking evaluation toolkit supporting multi-user online VR. For the basic usage of the toolkit, please refer to the project as well as the original [OpenRDW](https://github.com/yaoling1997/OpenRDW) project.

Scripts are located in `Assets/OpenRDW/Scripts/`. The main controller is implemented as `Assets/OpenRDW/Scripts/Redirection/Redirectors/Bypassing_Redirector.cs`.

Experimental setting files are located in `BatchFiles/` and `CommandFiles/`.
